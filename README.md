📌 Project Overview
This project implements a real-time Emotion Detection system using Python and OpenCV. The model analyzes human facial expressions from live webcam input or images and predicts emotions such as Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprised, Neutral, etc. It combines computer vision techniques with machine learning to perform accurate and efficient emotion classification.

🎯 Objective
To detect human emotions by analyzing facial expressions in real time, enabling applications in human–computer interaction, mental health analysis, and intelligent surveillance systems.

🧠 How It Works
Captures live video feed using OpenCV
Detects faces using a face detection algorithm
Preprocesses facial images (grayscale conversion, resizing, normalization)
Feeds the processed face into a trained ML model
Predicts and displays the detected emotion in real time

🛠️ Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy
Machine Learning: Supervised learning model for emotion classification
Computer Vision: Face detection and image preprocessing
